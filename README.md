#  Bubble Analyser

Bubble Analyser is a Matlab Application for processing and quantifying bubble images, normally taken for assessing froth flotation equipment.

## Installation

You can simply download a copy of the latest version from the GitLab repository as a .zip (or equivalent) file. Unzip the file and keep the unpacked folder wherever you prefer—We recommend to put it in the default Matlab folder. Once you have decided where to keep it, make sure you add this location to your Matlab path. For help on doing this, please refer to this [link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html).

## Usage

If you have added the ‘Bubble Analyser’ folder to your Matlab path, you can run the APP by:
```>> BubbleAnalyserApp()```

Bubble Analyser was developed for Matlab 2020, or newer. However, it might run with older versions of Matlab. Bubble Analyser uses the following Toolboxes: Image Processing and Signal Processing.
